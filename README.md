## 📊Key Insights from the Dashboard
## 📅 Monthly Trends
June had the highest total revenue and most items sold, indicating a potential seasonal peak (could be due to promotions, weather, or holidays).
Revenue shows a steady decline from March to February, suggesting possible seasonal drops, stock issues, or reduced marketing activity during those months.

## 📦 Top Performing Product Categories
Coffee is the leading category in both revenue and volume, confirming it as the shop’s main profit driver.
## 📈 Product Type Performance
Hot chocolate and Gourmet brewed coffee show strong volume, indicating customer preferences for prepared drinks.
Drip coffee and Organic beans also contribute significantly to item sales, likely driven by repeat buyers or subscriptions.
Tea follows with high item sales but slightly lower revenue, suggesting it's a high-volume, low-margin item.
Bakery items perform well in sales volume, making them good complementary upsell products.
### 📐 AOV & Quantity Metrics
Average Order Value (AOV) is 3.38, which indicates most transactions are low-cost items or small orders.
Average Quantity per order is 1.44, showing that customers usually purchase 1–2 items per visit.
